## Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub

I want to learn Git and GitHub because it will be crucial for my future profession, knowing the basic commands and work arounds of Git and GitHub would make it easier for me once I am finally in the working industry. This will also be useful in collaborating with my classmates for projects, activities, or assignments. And as our teacher, Elmer Alvarado said interviewers will look at your GitHub profile to see what are your experiences and how active or passionate you are about this profession.
