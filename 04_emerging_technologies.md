# Emerging Technology: Extended Reality (XR)

## Purpose
At its core, XR is “reality-plus” technology that works with any type of display. It combines both VR and AR capabilities to enhance our interaction with digital content. It encompasses any technology that either immerses you in a virtual environment (VR), adds digital elements to your surroundings (AR), or combines both approaches (MR).
